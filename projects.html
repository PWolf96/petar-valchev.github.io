					<p>Garviz is an application which helps bringing objectivity in a subjective game like football. It aims to assist clubs, coaches or players who wish to get to the next level by making data driven decision-making. The application has three main functionalitiies.</p>
					<p>GATHER - the place where users can capture all the information for your team. Store data for coaches, players, sessions and matches.</p>
					<p>VISUALIZE - the place where users can look at the story of your team through dashboards. Create reports for team or player performance and share them with relevant stakeholders.</p>
					<p>ANALYZE - the place where users can gain insights that are not possible to catch with the human eye with the help of AI and Machine Learning models.</p>
					<p>The full stack application has been built using React as the front-end framework and Python-Flask as the back-end api which utilizes sql-alchemy ORM to communicate with a MSSQL database. The app has been built with the user in mind, allowing for flexibility and customization. Users can share teams, and assign different priviledges to users within a team. Furthermore, when it comes to gathering event data, the user can define the type of data to me collected. The application takes advantage of JWT authentication and authorization. It has been deployed as a web service using azure cloud services.</p>
					<p>The analyze section will take advantage of data science and machine learning algorithms to uncover hidden patterns in the data that has been gathered from teams. The use of association analysis will help find the most probable outcomes given a user defined scenario while LSTM will allow the users to reflect on playing styles of both teams and players.</p>

				<article id="patterns">
					<h2 class="major">Predicting patterns of play</h2>
					<p>A Markov process is a process where predictions can be made regarding future outcomes based on the current state of play. In a given sequence of events, it iterates through each event where for each iteration it pairs the event with its descendant, labelling the first current state and the latter subsequent state. Each state has a list of all the different states (including itself) it can lead to and their frequency, forming a probability of going from it to another one. In the end, random sequences will be generated with an algorithm using those probabilities to form the most probable series of events given a certain event-location is the start.</p>
					<img src="images\patterns-1.PNG" alt="pattern1" style="width: 100%">
					<p>Markov chains are characterized as memoryless meaning that they generate the subsequent event only based on the current one and not on the ones before that. In the context of football, this approach will not provide the full context as it matters whether a player for example receives the ball from a short pass on the ground or from a 40m long ball. More accurate models exists that take those considerations into account and they will be explored in future articles. However, for the purpose of the analysis, the Markov model will be explored in its memoryless form.</p>
					<h3 style="margin-top: 100px;">Methodology:</h3>
					<p>The dataset that will be used is the WSL 2020/2021 season data provided by StatsBomb free data repository. All games that Chelsea WFC have played have been filtered in order to produce a dataset of events which occurred only during their games. Several assumptions have been made to aid the analysis, namely:</p>
					<p>1. The pitch has been split into 30 zones</p>
					<p>Analysing the coordinates of each event independently would not yield any insights due to the variable nature of event coordinates. Hence, the pitch has been split into zone containers each representing a certain range between X and Y coordinates. Figure 1 outlines the zones in which the pitch was split. The zones split the pitch into 6 laterally in order to break down the opposition half into 3rds and into 5 longitudinally in order to include the half-spaces which have become popular in modern football.</p>
					<img src="images\patterns-2.PNG" alt="pattern2" style="width: 100%">
					<p>Events have then been added to their respective containers. This forms a link between the event and the zone it happened which will be represented in the following format:</p>
					<p>{Event Type} — {Event Zone}</p>
					<p>An example itemset of a shot would look like the following:</p>
					<p>(Pass-Zone6) -> (Interception-Zone9) -> (Carry-Zone9) -> (Pass-Zone9) -> (Carry-Zone3)</p>
					<p>2. Carry and Ball Receipt events have been filtered out from the dataset</p>
					<p>Both have been deemed to not add extra value over using just the Pass event in the context of the analysis. Every Pass has a Ball Receipt linked to it which is very rarely positioned in a different zone to the next event, making it redundant. Just like passes are coupled with ball receipts, in the dataset used, every time a ‘Dribble’ event occurs it is coupled with a ‘Carry’ event. Upon inspection, it was determined that ‘Carry’ events provide more information in the context of the analysis and were kept over ‘Dribble’ events.</p>
					<p>3. Possessions against Chelsea have been filtered out</p>
					<p>Since the purpose of this analysis is to concentrate on predicting what Chelsea WFC do when they are in possession, all possessions from other teams have been excluded from the dataset to avoid misleading results.</p>
					<p>Once the dataset has been cleaned, all the event-zone combinations have been added to a list. This list is then iterated through to create a Markov model containing the probabilities of advancing onto any other event-zone combination given the current state. For the purpose of this exercise, this will be sufficient in order to generate stories.</p>
					<p>To generate a random possession, a starting state will need to be passed onto the algorithm as well as the length of the sequence we want to generate. The algorithm will then use the probabilities that have been generated from the Markov model to create a passing sequence to the desired length. In theory, any event-zone combination can be passed as a starting state, but for the purpose of this analysis, only four states will be looked into. Similarly, a possession of any length can be generated and for this analysis, the assumed length of a possession will be five events. Lastly, nine hypothetical possessions will be generated for each state.</p>
					<p>The only step left is to define the states of interest. For this purpose, a heat map, containing all the events during the 20/21 season will be used to determine the most used zones from the team.</p>
					<img src="images\patterns-3.PNG" alt="pattern3" style="width: 100%">
					<p>Figure 2 outlines the commonly used areas by the team while in possession. It can be seen that Chelsea has made use of Zones 11,16 on the left-hand side and Zones 15,20 on the right-hand side. Only zones 16 and 20 will be used as states as they are closer to the opponent’s goal. On top of those 2 zones, passes from Zone 3 will be included in order to represent a probable sequence of events following a goal kick from Chelsea, as well as Zone 21, considered to be one of the zones most frequently leading to a shot as per the previous article.</p>
					<h3 style="margin-top: 100px;">Results:</h3>
					<p>Pass-Zone 3</p>
					<img src="images\patterns-4.PNG" alt="pattern4" style="width: 100%">
					<p>Looking at the nine hypothetical cases that have been generated from the algorithm for ‘Pass-Zone3’ it can be seen that there is an equal spread between resolving to play out from the back and making the decision to play over the first line of the opposition directly to the middle 3rd. An interesting trend can be observed when the team do decide to play over the first line of defence, they mainly resolve to playing in Zone 11 which is on the left-hand side of the pitch. Looking further into the sequence, once the ball reaches Zone 11 it is being progressed forward through the wide areas into Zones 16 and 21 with only one occasion where it is being passed back and recycled(7). When a decision is made to play out from the back, rather unsurprisingly the following four plays do not progress the ball further onto the pitch but is played between players in the zones in front of the goal, possibly to force a reaction from the opposition.</p>
					<p>Pass-Zone 16</p>
					<img src="images\patterns-5.PNG" alt="pattern5" style="width: 100%">
					<p>The generated sequences starting with Pass-Zone16 show a preference for slow build-up instead of a direct approach. Upon inspection, only one sequence (2) presents an attack which ends up in Zone 28. Instead, the algorithm insists that it is more likely for the team to make short passes in the attempt to consolidate possession or to move the ball to the other side of the pitch. There has also been a lack of long ball switches from the left-hand side to the right-hand side which serves as a further indication of the team’s preference to play short passes when in that area.</p>
					<p>Pass-Zone 20</p>
					<img src="images\patterns-6.PNG" alt="pattern6" style="width: 100%">
					<p>Similar to the previous case, Pass-Zone20 offers little difference in principle to what was observed when the team was in a similar position but on the other side of the pitch. The most probable sequence in this area consists of short passes which aim to consolidate possession or to switch the area of play to the other side of the pitch. Two outliers are presented in (3) and (5) which show attempts for a more direct play.</p>
					<p>Pass-Zone 21</p>
					<img src="images\patterns-7.PNG" alt="pattern7" style="width: 100%">
					<p>Looking at Pass-Zone21 becomes more interesting as the area is positioned in the attacking 3rd of the pitch and one would expect to see more assertive plays to attack the opposition goal. And indeed a shot has been included in the sequence in three (1),(3), and (8) of the nine generated samples which can serve as an indication of the team’s potency to create a shooting chance from that area. In those cases, the shot has been preceded by either a cross (1),(8) or a switch into the opposite half-space, something that could be worth analysing in depth. It can also be observed the high presence of Pressure events which can serve as an initial indication of counter-pressing tactical instructions in the final 3rd.</p>
					<h3 style="margin-top: 100px;">Conclusion:</h3>
					<p>In this article, a season-long dataset of events for Chelsea WFC has been analysed and a Markov chain has been constructed to calculate the probabilities of transitioning from one state to another. This has then been used to simulate possessions with a pre-determined starting point. For the purpose of the analysis 4 starting points have been analysed namely: a goal kick Pass-Zone3 passes starting in the most active areas for the team Pass-Zone16 and Pass-Zone20 and passes from an area determined to be potent for creating shots Pass-Zone21. By running only nine simulations, some potentially interesting insights can be observed like the team preferring to pass to the left-hand side of the pitch if it makes a decision to skip the first line of defence or that when in Zone20 or Zone16 the team would rather consolidate possession than look for a direct approach. Pass-Zone21 had 30% of its simulations ending with a shot which confirms its potency to create shots, it also visually recreated the way that is most likely for the team to create a shooting chance — with crosses.</p>
					<p>Markov chains are stochastic in nature and only nine simulations are not a big enough sample size to reach any conclusions. Having a higher number of simulations would generate a set of sequences which would together contain a more accurate representation of what a given team is capable of. Those can then be labelled and fed into the coaching staff providing the insights that could allow for a better understanding of the analysed team.</p>
					<p>In this case, five events in total have provided satisfactory results but they can be changed to reflect the needs of the user.The accuracy of the probabilities can be further increased by taking into account the action that led to the current state, however for that to be feasible, a bigger dataset is required.</p>

				<!-- Intro -->
				<article id="contribution1">
					<h2 class="major">Intro</h2>
					<p>This article will explore the possibility of evaluating player contribution to shots. Inspired by an article written by StatsBomb, a first-order Markov model will be constructed to take into account all events that have happened in a single season for Chelsea WFC and evaluate their contribution towards a shot.</p>
					<h3 style="margin-top: 100px;">First order Markov chain</h3>
					<p>A Markov chain is a random process describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends on events that happened before. This analysis will use a first-order Markov chain meaning that the probability of each event depends only on the state attained in the previous event. A graphical representation of the chain is given in Figure 1. The chain is divided into transition states and absorption states.</p>
					<img src="images\markov1-1.PNG" alt="markov1-1" style="width: 100%">
					<p>States that have a probability of transitioning into another state are called transient states.</p>
					<p>States in which the probability of remaining in the state is 1 are called absorption states.</p>
					<p>Once the probabilities involving all states are calculated, a matrix is constructed to reflect those probabilities called a transition matrix. Similarly, an absorption matrix is constructed reflecting the probabilities of each transient state resulting in an absorption state. The probability of reaching an absorption state from a given transient state in n-steps is calculated. A fundamental matrix is derived from the transition matrix which is then used to calculate the expected number of plays as its row sums. Finally, the ‘contribution factor’ is calculated by the product of the fundamental matrix and the absorption matrix.</p>
					<h3 style="margin-top: 100px;">Methodology:</h3>
					<p>To achieve the analysis, the necessary cleaning process needs to be carried out. As with previous analyses, the cleaning starts with splitting the pitch into 30 zones and excluding the events which are determined to not add any additional value to the possession chains. Furthermore, only shots which meet a certain xG threshold would be considered shots. For a more detailed explanation of these steps, previous posts can be checked.</p>
					<img src="images\patterns-2.PNG" alt="markov1-2" style="width: 100%">
					<p>For absorption states two possible outcomes will be considered, namely:</p>
					<p>- Shot</p>
					<p>- Loss of possession</p>
					<p>Whether the possession ends with a shot, which is considered a positive outcome, or loss of possession, a negative outcome. A decision has been made to include shots as an outcome instead of goals as even though goals provide the highest value in the context of a football game, some valuable plays which do not end up in a goal get missed out. Similarly with shots, there will be valuable plays which will not result in a shot. However, less valuable plays will be missed out through tracking shots, than goals since the first one occurs more frequently than the latter. In that respect, it is believed that having shots as an outcome will capture the true value of a player to a greater extent.</p>
					<p>In terms of transition states, for the purpose of this analysis, we are interested in the zones which contribute to a positive outcome the most. For this reason, each zone will be considered a transient state. On top of that four more set-piece scenarios have been added, namely:</p>
					<p>- Goal kick</p>
					<p>- Throw in</p>
					<p>- Corner</p>
					<p>- Free kick</p>
					<p>Combined together there are 34 transient states which will be used.</p>
					<p>Once the transient and absorption states are known, the dataset would need to be manipulated to accommodate for the analysis. The dataset is divided into possession sequences where each possession sequence is considered individually. Each event in the possession is then coupled with its descendant, meaning that for any given event, the current state is the zone or set-piece that it has occurred in and the next state is the zone or set-piece of the next event in the couple. An exception is only made for the last event of a possession sequence where the next state ends in either a ‘shot’ or a ‘loss of possession’. Events after manipulation are shown in Table 1.</p>
					<img src="images\markov1-2.PNG" alt="markov1-3" style="width: 100%">
					<p>A Markov model is then run on the dataset to generate the probabilities of going between transient states and absorption states. This will then be used to calculate the shot contribution value of each transient state. This will be achieved with the following matrices:</p>
					<p>(1) 34x34 transition matrix — containing the probabilities of each transition state to end up in any other transition state</p>
					<p>(2) 34x2 absorption matrix — containing the probabilities of each transition state to end up in the respective absorption state</p>
					<p>(3) 34x34 identity matrix</p>
					<p>(4) 34x34 fundamental matrix — the inverse of the identity matrix minus the transition matrix</p>
					<p>The probability of each transition state leading to an absorption state is calculated by the product of the fundamental matrix and absorption matrix. When the probabilities are known, the player contribution can be calculated by assessing if the play done by the particular player increases the probability of a shot or decreases it. When the next event is a shot the probability is equal to 1 and if it is a loss in possession then it is equal to 0.</p>
					<p>Player contribution = Probability of a shot | Next event — Probability of a shot | Current event</p>
					<h3 style="margin-top: 100px;">Results:</h3>
					<p>Results of the probabilities have been presented in Figures 2 and 3.</p>
					<img src="images\markov1-3.PNG" alt="markov1-4" style="width: 100%">
					<img src="images\markov1-4.PNG" alt="markov1-5" style="width: 100%">
					<p>Figure 2 shows that rather unsurprisingly, zone 28 is the area which has the highest probability of preceding a shot. It is followed by corners which serves as an indication that the team takes advantage of corner set-pieces to generate shots. It can be observed that the left-hand side area has a slight edge for shot generation Zone26 narrowly edges Zone 24 and is followed by Zone 22 whilst Zone29 and Zone27 have a fairly similar probability. On the other end of the field, as expected, are the areas which contribute to a shot the least, with the lowest being Zone1 and Zone5.</p>
					<p>The derived equation for player contribution has been used to evaluate each event. In the end, all events in which a particular player has been involved have been summed to calculate the player’s season contribution towards shots for the team. The results are presented in Figure 4.</p>
					<img src="images\markov1-5.PNG" alt="markov1-6" style="width: 100%">
					<p>Analysing Figure 4 provides some interesting insights. Unsurprisingly, the model determines Sam Kerr as the player with the highest contribution towards shots with Pernille Harder and Francesca Kirby second and third. This could be largely influenced by those three players being the ones with the most shots on the team, meaning that they convert chances into shots which would eventually score goals. On the other hand, it could also serve as an indication that those players progress the ball successfully into more dangerous areas more often than not. On the other side, we can see that Bethany England has the lowest shot contribution from the team. The result can be broken down into a few potential reasons. Firstly, the model punishes giving possession away, meaning that if the play style of the player is to attempt many aggressive and high-risk passes albeit most of them being unsuccessful, it would drive down contribution due to the fact that the ball is given away more times than chances have been created. Secondly, players which tend to be on the other side of the spectrum and play too many safe passes in advanced areas are also punished by the model since instead of progressing the ball into an area with a higher possibility of a positive outcome, the ball is recycled and chances are not taken. Figure 5 represents the difference between the current model and the one that was built, taking into account if the player was under pressure during the event. In some cases, a player not being under pressure in deeper zones might prove to be more impactful for creating a shot than being under pressure in an advanced area. With that regard, the model which includes pressure has the potential to be more accurate.</p>
					<img src="images\markov1-6.PNG" alt="markov1-7" style="width: 100%">
					<p>It can be observed that the values have not changed much, mainly due to the fact that in the most dangerous areas, players will very rarely not be under pressure.</p>
					<p>It is important to clarify that the model does not take into account any tactical considerations where players are tasked with the responsibility of consolidating play or ones who are given the freedom to attempt riskier passes with the possibility of making that one killer pass that will ultimately decide a game. Different models can then be constructed, using different transition and absorption states to capture any specific coaching requirements. Furthermore, the model does not take into account the context of the event. Details such as state of the game, opponent or occasion have not been taken into account. Differentiating between whether the player was under pressure or not did not provide significant changes. Estimation accuracy can also be improved by implementing a higher-order Markov model which takes into account the previous state before reaching the current one. Lastly, the model does not consider how events transition from one state to another. A Markov decision process could be constructed to accommodate that need.</p>
					<h3 style="margin-top: 100px;">Conclusion:</h3>
					<p>A first-order Markov model has been constructed and used to analyse the 20/21 season of Chelsea WFC. It aimed to evaluate players based on their contribution towards creating shooting chances and taking shooting opportunities. It was also used to get a visual representation of which zones have the highest probability of creating a shooting chance where it was concluded that the left-hand side is slightly more dangerous than the right-hand side with corners possessing the second highest threat of a shot after Zone 28. Players playing in forward or midfield positions yield the highest shot contribution. Defenders having low shot contribution values can serve as an indication that Chelsea does not use defenders as much to progress the ball into dangerous positions. This can be a result of tactical instructions or a lack of qualities to do so. Interesting insights have been extracted when looking at the least contributing players, which can lead to analysis in further detail when raised to the coaching staff.</p>
					<p>Player evaluation has always been a crucial part of any competitive team. Recognising players as ones who perform up to standard and on the other hand, players who need to be developed further is embedded into the work cycle of any coaching staff. Before the digital era, conclusions have been deducted primarily based on subjectivity. However, technology has given the opportunity for a more objective approach to player evaluation based on pre-agreed criteria. A vast amount of parameters can be taken into account over a long time span, helping to uncover certain players’ merit, which could have been invisible to the naked eye. In doing so, a team can not only recognise and retain talent more effectively but also scout and uncover hidden gems which can vastly improve certain aspects of the team, something which in the long run can make a difference.</p>
